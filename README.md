## Info

> **jellify** (verb) - _to make gelatinous_ <br>
> [see also](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jellify)

_Jellify_ is a free and open source music player for the [Jellyfin Media Server](https://jellyfin.org/). Built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), it is available for both iOS and Android.

> _Jellify_ requires a connection to a [Jellyfin Media Server](https://jellyfin.org/) server to work. [See also](https://jellyfin.org/docs/)

Showcasing the artwork of your library, it has a user interface congruent to what _the big guys_ do. _Jellify_ also provides algorithmic curation of your music (not that you have to use _Jellify_ that way). It's designed to be lightweight, and scale to even the largest of music libraries (...like 100K tracks large).

### Background

This app was designed with me and my dad in mind. I wanted us to have a sleek, one stop shop for live recordings of bands we like (read: the Grateful Dead). The UI was designed so that we'd find it instantly familiar and useful. CarPlay / Android Auto support was also a must for us, as we both use CarPlay religiously.

### Recommended Additions

These projects are **not** required to use _Jellify_, but are recommended by us to enrich your Jellyfin music experience!

- [Apple Music Plugin](https://github.com/lyarenei/jellyfin-plugin-itunes)
  - Really good at fetching missing artist artwork for obscure / less popular artists
- [LrcLib Plugin](https://repo.jellyfin.org/files/plugin/manifest.json)
  - Available in the default plugins catalog
  - Really good at fetching song lyrics
- [Jellyfin Rewind](https://github.com/Chaphasilor/jellyfin-rewind)
  - Gives a recap of your year in music listening similar to other music streaming services
  - [A hosted version is provided here](https://jellyfin-rewind.chaphasilor.xyz/)
- [Spotify Playlist Imports](https://github.com/Viperinius/jellyfin-plugin-spotify-import)
  - Imports a user's Spotify playlists into Jellyfin
  - Can run as a scheduled task
- [AudioMuse-AI](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI) and it's [associated plugin](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/audiomuse-ai-plugin)
  - Performs sonic analysis on your music
  - Creates "smart playlists" based on tempo and mood
- [Jellyfin-RPC](https://github.com/Radiicall/jellyfin-rpc)
  - Displays the content you're currently playing on Discord

## Run locally

These are minimal steps to get the project running for local development. This repository is a React Native app — follow the platform-specific steps below.

Requirements
- Node.js >= 18
- Yarn (recommended) or npm
- For iOS builds: macOS with Xcode and CocoaPods
- For Android builds: Android Studio / SDK

Quick start (PowerShell)

```powershell
# install dependencies (yarn is recommended)
yarn install

# iOS (macOS only) - install CocoaPods
cd ios; bundle install || echo "bundle not installed"; pod install; cd ..

# start Metro bundler
yarn start

# in another terminal: run app on Android or iOS simulator/device
yarn android
# or
yarn ios
```

If you don't have Yarn installed, use npm:

```powershell
npm install
npm run start
npm run android
npm run ios
```

Notes
- The repository uses `patch-package` as a `postinstall` step; keep that in mind during installs.
- If you encounter native build issues, make sure your Xcode/Android SDK and related tooling are up to date.
- This README contains a short fork attribution and some badge links updated to point at this repository.
